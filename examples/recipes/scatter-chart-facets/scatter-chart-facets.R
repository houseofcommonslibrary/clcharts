# This is an example of how to make a faceted scatter chart using the clcharts
# package.
#
# This script is self-contained: running it will create a PNG and an SVG of the
# example chart in the same directory. To run the script will need to ensure:
#
# 1. You have installed all of the packages that the script imports
# 2. You have the theme fonts set up on your computer
# 3. You have the dataset "scatter-chart-facets.csv" in the same directory
#
# See the readme on GitHub to find out how to install the package and setup
# the fonts.
#
# To run the script, type the following code in your R console:
#
# source("scatter-chart-facets.R")

# Imports ---------------------------------------------------------------------

library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(clcharts)

# Read in and prepare the data ------------------------------------------------

# Load the data from the csv as a dataframe
df <- read_csv("scatter-chart-facets.csv")

# Turn the classification column into a factor: setting the order of the levels
# controls the order of the categories in the legend from top to bottom
settlement_classes <- c(
    "London",
    "Other city",
    "Large town",
    "Medium town",
    "Small town",
    "Village")

df$classification <- factor(df$classification, levels = settlement_classes)

# Create the plot -------------------------------------------------------------

# Use ggplot to create a plot with data and mappings

        data = df,
        mapping = aes(x = median_age, y = turnout, color = classification)) +
    # Add a point geometry to add points: set shape = 16 to match house style

    # limits and the y axis labels to show percentages to the nearest percent,
    # turn off the expansion on both axes
    scale_x_continuous(
        limits = c(25, 55),

        label = percent_format(accuracy = 1),
        expand = c(0, 0)) +

    # both horizontal and vertical, and turn off the legend

# Save the plot in different formats ------------------------------------------

# Save a high resolution export of the plot as a png
